Secure Cloud Storage Demo: Presentation Guide
Intermediary Steps in the Demo
Your recent UI improvements have already done a great job of showing the intermediary steps in the demo - each major operation (upload, download, update, delete, key rotation) now has a clear sequential flow with numbered steps and progress indicators. During your presentation:
Highlight that this step-by-step approach is intentional for educational purposes
Mention that in a production app, these steps would happen behind the scenes
Point out the visual indicators (progress bars, code snippets) that help illustrate the cryptographic operations
